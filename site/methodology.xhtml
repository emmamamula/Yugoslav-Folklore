                <h2>##Selection of Poems</h2>
                <br />
                <p>For this project, our group elected to use a mixture of poems in the original
                    Serbian as well as translated English versions. While working solely in Serbian
                    may have been preferable, the collective group's Serbian knowledge wasn't strong
                    enough to gather a fully Serbian corpus while maintaining any sort of parity of
                    work. Therefore, we decided to do half-English, half-Serbian.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The English-language *Anthology of Jugoslav Poetry* edited by Dr. Beatrice L.
                    Stevenson was the best available source for English. It was both extensive, and
                    old enough that it was outside copyright restrictions (as a plus, it was
                    available in plain-text on Project Gutenburg, eliminating necessary
                    transcription work).</p>
                <br />
                <p>However, there are two major concerns in the work. Firstly, the translations may
                    not be as faithful to the original as we would like. For example, in poem VII of
                    the anthology, the line "And my drink metheglin sweet" appears. Metheglin is a
                    fairly specific adjective, referring to mead, and while Serbia and the Balkan
                    region does have an equivalent, "metheglin" itself is more common in British
                    writing, casting some doubt on the translations as a whole. We can't aim to
                    rectify this situation ourselves by checking the questionable spots, not only
                    because Emma, our sole Serbian-speaker of any competence would be dramatically
                    overworked, but because in any case, we don't have the original Serbian versions
                    of our English poems, drawing them from a second source. The second concern may
                    not be a problem, but the limited focus of the anthology on "women's songs"
                    drove our research in that direction, which influences strongly our
                    conclusions.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Our Serbian sources have a less complicated backstory. We draw them from Projekat
                    Rastko, an online database of Serbian culture. The poems on this site are
                    generally much shorter than the ones in the *Anthology* and do not feature
                    stanzas. In total, we have 15 Serbian-language poems and 10 English-language
                    poems.</p>
                <br />
                <h2>##Markup</h2>
                <br />
                <p>The markup for this project includes fairly few different element types, but
                    quite a few attributes. We are not using many of these for the current phase of
                    the project, because once you get down into using more than two attributes
                    simultaneously, our dataset becomes too thin to make any real conclusions. In
                    the future, once a larger quantity of poems are marked up, we can use them all
                    to see how relationships, for example, affect the distribution of
                    adjectives.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The Serbian and English sources use different schemas due to different structure.
                    For example, no schemas in the Serbian source, while the English source doesn't
                    have performance instructions. Serbian, unsurprisingly, doesn't have a
                    translator whereas the English one obviously does. However, the schemas were
                    standardized down to the level of line and below, which is where all our
                    relevant markup is located.</p>

                <h2>###Nouns</h2>
                <br />
                <p>Our noun element was `noun`. In this instance, noun referred not only to proper
                    and common nouns, but also, frequently, to pronouns as well. - `gender`: In our
                    project, we classified four gender: male, female, unknown, and plural. Male and
                    female are fairly self-explanitory, but also not necessary easy. In poem V in
                    the English source, Harvest Song, for example, we had to puzzle out who was male
                    and female based on context cues and assumption about medieval Serbian farming
                    practices. Unknown was used largely for animals (not uncommon in the English
                    source) and plural was used when there was a mixed group of both males and
                    females. - `relation`: Relation could be set as "fam" for family, "rom" for
                    romantic, and "gen" for general, ie, anyone other than a family member or
                    romantic partner. We wanted to see how descriptions changed based on whether
                    characters were romantic partners or family members. Sometimes, this was harder
                    to classify than one would think, given that a "bride", depending on the
                    narrator could be a romantic partner, or a daughter-in-law, a family member.
                    Given that we have too few of any individual kind to draw conclusions, this is
                    not currently used. - `type`: Type was used to keep track of whether something
                    was a name or not. Another researcher might think it was interesting what names
                    popped up most frequently in the text but we did not end up using this
                    attribute. Interestingly, proper names seem much more common in the Serbian
                    sources. - `id`: the xsd:ID element let us give each noun a unique identifier so
                    we could link it to one or more adjectives. This is not used in the current
                    phase of the project.</p>
                <br />
                <h2>###Adjectives</h2>
                <br />
                <p>Our adjective element was `adj`. It featured the following attributes. -
                    `posneg`: Posneg was either positive or negative. If something was neither
                    positive nor negative, we did not mark it. This is unquestionably the single
                    most important attribute in the project (with gender, of course), because our
                    research focuses on how the connotations of adjectives apply to the characters
                    of different genders, and is, along with gender, the attribute that we use in
                    the current phase of our project. - `gender`: Same as in nouns, which makes it
                    slightly redundant. However, given the structure of xpath, it is much easier to
                    find the adjectives of a certain connotation and gender if both are attributes
                    within the same element so we thought it worth the trouble including it again. -
                    `ref`: xsd:IDREF allows us to match one or more adjectives to a single noun, so
                    that Smilia of Poem IV can be a maiden that is not only sweet, but also young
                    and fair.</p>
