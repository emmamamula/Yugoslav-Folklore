                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <br />
                <h3>Selection of Poems</h3>
                <p>For this project, our <a
                        href="https://github.com/emmamamula/Yugoslav-Folklore/graphs/contributors"
                        ><i><b>group</b></i></a> elected to use a mixture of poems in the original Serbian as
                    well as translated English versions. While working solely in Serbian may have
                    been preferable, the collective group's Serbian knowledge wasn't strong enough
                    to gather a fully Serbian corpus while maintaining any sort of parity of work.
                    Therefore, we decided to do half-English, half-Serbian.</p>
                <p><i><b>The English-language</b></i> <a
                        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36091/36091-h/36091-h.htm"><i><b>Anthology
                        of Jugoslav Poetry</b></i></a> edited by Dr. Beatrice L. Stevenson was the best
                    available source for English. It was both extensive, and old enough that it was
                    outside copyright restrictions (as a plus, it was available in plain-text on
                    Project Gutenburg, eliminating necessary transcription work).</p>
                <p>However, there are two major concerns in the work. Firstly, the translations may
                    not be as faithful to the original as we would like. For example, in poem <a
                        href="http://serb-songs.obdurodon.org/english-corpus.xhtml#PoemVII"
                        ><i><b>VII</b></i></a> of the anthology, the line "<i>And my drink metheglin sweet</i>"
                    appears. Metheglin is a fairly specific adjective, referring to mead, and while
                    Serbia and the Balkan region does have an equivalent, "<i>metheglin</i>" itself is more
                    common in British writing, casting some doubt on the translations as a whole. We
                    can't aim to rectify this situation ourselves by checking the questionable
                    spots, not only because Emma, our sole Serbian-speaker of any competence would
                    be dramatically overworked, but because in any case, we don't have the original
                    Serbian versions of our English poems, drawing them from a second source. The
                    second concern may not be a problem, but the limited focus of the anthology on
                    "<i>women's songs</i>" drove our research in that direction, which influences strongly
                    our conclusions.</p>
                <p>Our Serbian sources have a less complicated backstory. We draw them from <a
                        href="https://www.rastko.rs/"><i><b>Projekat Rastko</b></i></a>, an online database of
                    Serbian culture. The poems on this site are generally much shorter than the ones
                    in the Anthology and do not feature stanzas. In total, we have 15
                    Serbian-language poems and 10 English-language poems.</p>
                <h3>Markup</h3>
                <p>The markup for this project includes fairly few different element types, but
                    quite a few attributes. We are not using many of these for the current phase of
                    the project, because once you get down into using more than two attributes
                    simultaneously, our dataset becomes too thin to make any real conclusions. In
                    the future, once a larger quantity of poems are marked up, we can use them all
                    to see how relationships, for example, affect the distribution of
                    adjectives.</p>
                <p>The Serbian and English sources use different schemas due to different structure.
                    For example, no schemas in the Serbian source, while the English source doesn't
                    have performance instructions. Serbian, unsurprisingly, doesn't have a
                    translator whereas the English one obviously does. However, the schemas were
                    standardized down to the level of line and below, which is where all our
                    relevant markup is located.</p>
                <h3>Nouns</h3>
                <p>Our noun element was `noun`. In this instance, noun referred not only to proper
                    and common nouns, but also, frequently, to pronouns as well. - <b>`gender`</b>: In our
                    project, we classified four gender: <i>male, female, unknown, and plural</i>. <i>Male</i> and
                    <i>female</i> are fairly self-explanitory, but also not necessary easy. In poem <a
                        href="http://serb-songs.obdurodon.org/english-corpus.xhtml#PoemV"><i><b>V</b></i></a> in
                    the English source, Harvest Song, for example, we had to puzzle out who was <i>male</i>
                    and <i>female</i> based on context cues and assumption about medieval Serbian farming
                    practices. <i>Unknown</i> was used largely for animals (not uncommon in the English
                    source) and plural was used when there was a mixed group of both <i>males</i> and
                    <i>females</i>. - <b>`relation`:</b> Relation could be set as "<i><b>fam</b></i>" for family, "<i><b>rom</b></i>" for
                    romantic, and "<i><b>gen</b></i>" for general, ie, anyone other than a family member or
                    romantic partner.</p>
                <p>We wanted to see how descriptions changed based on whether characters were
                    romantic partners or family members. Sometimes, this was harder to classify than
                    one would think, given that a "<i>bride</i>", depending on the narrator could be a
                    romantic partner, or a daughter-in-law, a family member. Given that we have too
                    few of any individual kind to draw conclusions, this is not currently used. -
                    <b>`type`:</b> Type was used to keep track of whether something was a name or not.
                    Another researcher might think it was interesting what names popped up most
                    frequently in the text but we did not end up using this attribute.
                    Interestingly, proper names seem much more common in the Serbian sources. -
                   <b> `id`: the xsd:ID</b> element let us give each noun a unique identifier so we could
                    link it to one or more adjectives. This is not used in the current phase of the
                    project.</p>
                <h3>Adjectives</h3>
                <p>Our adjective element was <b>`adj`</b>. It featured the following attributes. -
                    <b>`posneg`</b>: Posneg was either <i>positive</i> or <i>negative</i>. If something was neither
                    <i>positive</i> nor <i>negative</i>, we did not mark it. This is unquestionably the single
                    most important attribute in the project (with gender, of course), because our
                    research focuses on how the connotations of adjectives apply to the characters
                    of different genders, and is, along with gender, the attribute that we use in
                    the current phase of our project. - <b>`gender`:</b> Same as in nouns, which makes it
                    slightly redundant. However, given the structure of xpath, it is much easier to
                    find the adjectives of a certain connotation and gender if both are attributes
                    within the same element so we thought it worth the trouble including it again. -
                    <b>`ref`: xsd:IDREF</b> allows us to match one or more adjectives to a single noun, so
                    that Smilia of <a
                        href="http://serb-songs.obdurodon.org/english-corpus.xhtml#PoemIV"><i><b>Poem
                        IV</b></i></a> can be a maiden that is not only sweet, but also young and fair.</p>
