                <p>The above graph shows the prevalence of male and female nouns in the text. As you can see, the majority of nouns and adjectives are both female.
                    This contridicts our hypothesis that they would be mentioned less than men. Additionally, you can see a gap at the top of the bars. This indicates
                    that not all nouns are male or female. Some were "unknown" - usually animals - or "plural" which we used to designate a mixed group. The rightmost
                    column shows how many adjectives were positive or negative. Not all adjectives were coded as such, a much larger number were neutral. As you can see,
                    the tone is generally positive.</p>

                <br />
                <p style="text-align:center;"><!--#include virtual="table.svg" --></p>
                <p>This table breaks down positive and negative adjectives by gender. As you can see, women have a higher proportion of positive adjectives than men and
                    are therefore generally described in more positive terms.</p>
