            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Folklore is an essential component that helps to shape the identity of a countries
                and their cultures. Countries of the former Yugoslavia have a rich and extensive
                history of folk music and poetry, some of which is featured in "An Anthology of
                Jugoslav Poetry" by Dr. B Stevenson Stanoyevich. This text analyzes the deeper
                religious, nationalistic, and emotional connotations of the poetry. This look into
                the realm of folklore is important because it acknowledges its relevance in the
                cultural shaping of the country. In this project I aim to research the gender
                aspects of traditional Yugoslav folk music and poetry.</p>
            <br />
            <p>We will use XML to mark up the pronouns and nouns, that are typically perceived as
                masculine or feminine in the lyrics and prose. Since Yugoslav culture tends to be
                patriarchal, We are interested in seeing whether or not women are more frequently
                described in the literature, or simply just described and how that is representative
                of the traditional culture as a whole.</p>
            <br />
            <p>We think using folk songs and poetry is useful because not only is it still popular
                in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, but it is also especially popular amongst
                the diaspora in the United States. The longevity of the literature speaks to its
                greater impact. The findings from this research would be useful for
                interdisciplinary studies, such as: Gender Studies, Slavic Studies, and Cultural
                Studies. It could also be used to develop into a broader study of the effects of
                nationally based music in Eastern Europe and how it can potentially provide social
                support for the continuation of patriarchal societies and traditional ideals. It
                will also help to shed light on how it is necessary to change how we interpret
                products of culture as we progress, but we must also be sure to not downplay its
                repercussions. This research could develop into a more sociological based study.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Serbia</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Officially the Republic of Serbia is a country situated at the crossroads of Central
                and Southeast Europe in the southern Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. The
                sovereign state borders Hungary to the north, Romania to the northeast, Bulgaria to
                the southeast, North Macedonia to the south, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to
                the west, and Montenegro to the southwest. The country claims a border with Albania
                through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia's population is about seven
                million. Its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the oldest and largest citiеs in
                southeastern Europe. </p>
