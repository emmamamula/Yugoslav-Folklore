                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>Our project consists of a gender-based analysis of Serbian folk songs based on both an English and Serbian source. We were interested in seeing the different nouns and adjectives used to refer to and describe women,but our main focus was on the connotation of the adjectives.Through XML mark-up we distinguished between male and female nouns and adjectives; for the adjectives we only noted the gender and whether it is positive or negative, but for the nouns we marked the gender, relationship (familial, general, or romantic) and the type of noun (a specific name or a general noun). </p>
                <p>For future work on this project, we would want to expand our corpus and extrapalate on the different categories of nouns that we marked. We were not able to include all the elements of our original research question due to the time constraints of the course.</p>
