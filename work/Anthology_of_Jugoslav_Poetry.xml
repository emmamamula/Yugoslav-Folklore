<title>THE CURSE[1]</title>

<stanza><line>I heard a sprightly swallow say</line>
<line>To a gray cuckoo t'other day,--</line>
<line>"Thou art a happy bird indeed;</line>
<line>Thou dost not in the chimney breed,</line>
<line>Thou dost not hear the eternal jarring,</line>
<line>Of sisters and step-sisters warring;</line>
<line>Their woes and grievances rehearsing,</line>
<line>Cursing themselves, and others cursing."</line>
<line>A young step-sister once I saw,</line>
<line>Foul language at the elder throw;</line>
<line>"Perdition's daughter! hence depart;</line>
<line>Thou hast no fruit beneath thy heart."</line>
<line>And thus the elder one replied:</line>
<line>"Curse thy perverseness and thy pride!</line>
<line>Mihailo is a son of thine;</line>
<line>Now thou shalt bring forth daughters nine,</line>
<line>And madness shall their portion be.</line>
<line>Thy son shall cross the parting sea;</line>
<line>He never shall return to thee,</line>
<line>But, bathed in blood and wounded, pine!"</line>
<line>And thus she cursed;--the curse was true;[2]</line>
<line>Her sister's nine fair daughters grew;</line>
<line>And madness seized them,--seized them all:</line>
<line>Mihailo,--far away, and wounded,</line>
<line>By solitude and woe surrounded,</line>
<line>I heard him on his mother call:</line>
<line>"O mother! mother! send me now</line>
<line>A bandage of that snowy linen</line>
<line>Which you so thoughtlessly were spinning,</line>
<line>When curses wander'd to and fro.</line>
<line>In your rage you wove it,--now remove it;</line>
<line>Tear it for bandages, as you tore</line>
<line>Love and affection all asunder.</line>
<line>Where it was bleach'd thy son lies under;</line>
<line>With it cover his hot wounds o'er.</line>
<line>Rend it, mother; and send it, mother!</line>
<line>May it thy suffering son restore!"</line></stanza>

<title>FAREWELL[3]</title>

<stanza><line>Against white Buda's walls, a vine</line>
<line>Doth its white branches fondly twine;</line>
<line>O, no! it was no vine-tree there;</line>
<line>It was a fond, a faithful pair,</line>
<line>Bound each to each in earliest vow--</line>
<line>And, O! they must be severed now!</line>
<line>And these their farewell words:--"We part--</line>
<line>Break from my bosom--break--my heart!</line>
<line>Go to a garden--go, and see,</line>
<line>Some rose-branch blushing on the tree;</line>
<line>And from that branch of rose-flower tear,</line>
<line>Then place it on thy bosom bare;</line>
<line>And as its leaflets fade and pine,</line>
<line>So fades my sinking heart in thine."</line>
<line>And thus the other spoke: "My love!</line>
<line>A few short paces backward move,</line>
<line>And to the verdant forest go;</line>
<line>There's a fresh water-fount below;</line>
<line>And in the fount a marble stone,</line>
<line>Which a gold cup reposes on;</line>
<line>And in the cup a ball of snow--</line>
<line>Love! take that ball of snow to rest</line>
<line>Upon thine heart within thy breast.</line>
<line>And as it melts unnoticed there,</line>
<line>So melts my heart in thine, my dear!"</line></stanza>

<title>THE VIOLET[4]</title>

<stanza><line>How captivating is to me,</line>
<line>Sweet flower! thine own young modesty!</line>
<line>Though did I pluck thee from thy stem,</line>
<line>There's none would wear thy purple gem.</line>
<line>I thought, perchance, that Ali Bey--</line>
<line>But he is proud and lofty--nay!</line>

<line>A flower so feeble though so fair:</line>
<line>His turban for its decorations</line>
<line>Had full blown roses and carnations.</line></stanza>

<title>SMILIA[5]</title>

<stanza><line>Sweet Smilia-flowers did Smilia pull,</line>
<line>Her sleevelets and her bosom full;</line>
<line>By the cool stream she gather'd them,</line>
<line>And twined her many a diadem--</line>
<line>A diadem of flowery-wreaths;--</line>
<line>One round her brows its fragrance breathes;</line>
<line>One to her bosom-friend she throws;</line>
<line>The other where the streamlet flows</line>
<line>She flings, and says in gentlest tone--</line>
<line>"Swim on, thou odorous wreath! swim on,</line>
<line>Swim to my Juris' home, and there</line>
<line>O whisper in his mother's ear:</line>
<line>'Say, wilt thou not thy Juris wed?--</line>
<line>Then give him not a widow's bed;</line>
<line>But some sweet maiden, young and fair.'"</line></stanza>

<title>MAIDEN'S PRAYER</title>

<stanza><line>Beauty's maiden thus invoked the Heavens:</line>
<line>"Send me down a whirlwind! let it scatter</line>
<line>Yonder stony tower--its halls lay open!</line>

<line>For my maiden said, "I'll come"--</line>
<line>Said "I'll come,"--but is not here:</line>

<line>Lone and silent home I turn'd;</line>
<line>But upon the bridge I met her--</line>
<line>Kiss'd her: How my hot lips burned!--</line>
<line>How forget it--how forget her!</line>
<line>In one kiss full ten I drew:</line>

<line>"Be blinded now, to you if heaven</line>
<line>All that is visible has given!</line>
<line>If ye see all, ye traitors, say</line>
<line>Why saw ye not my love to-day:--</line>

<line>He had a nosegay in his hand,--</line>
<line>He wore a gold embroider'd band.[10]</line>
<line>'Twas made by other hands than mine!</line>
<line>Upon it wreathing branches twine:</line>

<title>SALUTATION OF THE MORNING STAR</title>

<stanza><line>Lo! the maiden greets the day-star! "Sister!</line>
<line>Sister star of morning! well I greet thee;</line>
<line>Thou dost watch the world from thine uprising</line>
<line>To thy sinking hour.  In Hercegovina,</line>
<line>Tell me didst thou see the princely Stephan?</line>
<line>Tell me, was his snowy palace open,</line>
<line>Were his steeds caparisoned, and ready;</line>
<line>And was he equipp'd his bride to visit?"</line></stanza>

<stanza><line>Gently then the morning star responded:</line>
<line>"Lovely sister! beautiful young maiden,</line>
<line>True, I watch the world from my uprising</line>
<line>To my setting;--and in Hercegovina</line>
<line>Saw the palace of the princely Stephan;</line>
<line>And that snowy palace was wide open,</line>
<line>And his horse was saddled, and was ready,</line>
<line>And he was equipp'd his bride to visit:</line>
<line>But not thee--not thee--another maiden;</line>
<line>False tongues three have whisper'd evil of thee;</line>
<line>One has said--thine origin is lowly;</line>
<line>One, that thou art treacherous as a serpent;</line>

<stanza><line>Then the maiden pour'd her imprecations:</line>
<line>"He who said my origin was lowly,</line>
<line>Never let a child of love be born him;</line>
<line>He who called me treacherous as a serpent,</line>
<line>Round his heart, O! let a serpent wreathe it;</line>
<line>Through hot summers in his hair be tangled,</line>
<line>Through cold winters in his bosom nestle;</line>
<line>He who dar'd to call me dull and dreamy,</line>
<line>Nine long years may he be worn by sickness,</line>
<line>And no sleep renew his strength to bear it."</line></stanza>

<line>If some fond youth, some youth adored,</line>
<line>Might wear thee, should I weave thee now!</line>
<line>The finest gold I'd interblend,</line>

<title>THE FALCON</title>

<stanza><line>The falcon soars both far and high,</line>
<line>He spreads his pinions in the sky,</line>

<line>And seats him on the city's towers:</line>

<line>In crystal water bathe her face;</line>
<line>And looks with open, eager eye</line>
<line>Upon her neck of ivory:</line>
<line>White as the snow upon the mountain;</line>
<line>And there he hears a youth recounting</line>
<line>His tale of love.--"Now bend thy head</line>
<line>Upon thy snowy neck," he said;</line>
<line>"Its whiteness is too bright for me:</line>

<title>DEER AND VILA</title>

<stanza><line>A young deer tracked his way through the green forest,</line>
<line>One lonely day--another came in sadness;</line>
<line>And the third dawn'd, and brought him sighs and sorrow:</line>
<line>Then he address'd him to the forest Vila:</line>
<line>"Young deer!" she said, "thou wild one of the forest,</line>
<line>Now tell me what great sorrow has oppress'd thee?</line>
<line>Why wanderest thou thus in the forest lonely:</line>
<line>Lonely one day,--another day in sadness,--</line>
<line>And the third day with sighs and anguish groaning?"</line></stanza>

<stanza><line>And thus the young deer to the Vila answer'd:</line>
<line>"O thou sweet sister! Vila of the forest!</line>
<line>Me has indeed a heavy grief befallen;</line>
<line>For I had once a fawn, mine own beloved,</line>
<line>And one sad day she sought the running water:</line>
<line>She enter'd it, but came not back to bless me:</line>
<line>Then tell me, had she lost her way and wander'd?</line>
<line>Was she pursued and captured by the huntsman?</line>
<line>Or has she left me?--has she wholly left me?--</line>
<line>Loving some other deer--and I forgotten.</line>
<line>O! if she has but lost her way, and wanders,</line>
<line>Teach her to find it--bring her back to love me.</line>
<line>O! if she has been captured by the huntsman,</line>
<line>Then may a fate as sad as mine await him.</line>
<line>But if she has forsaken me--if, faithless,</line>
<line>She loves another deer--and I forgotten--</line>
<line>Then may the huntsman speedily o'er take her."</line></stanza>

<title>VIRGIN AND WIDOW</title>

<stanza><line>Over Sarajevo flies a falcon,</line>
<line>Looking round for cooling shade to cool him.</line>
<line>Then he finds a pine on Sarajevo;</line>
<line>Under it a well of sparkling water;</line>
<line>By the water, Hyacinth, the widow,</line>
<line>And the Rose, the young, unmarried virgin.</line>
<line>He look'd down--the falcon--and bethought him:</line>
<line>"Shall I kiss grave Hyacinth, the widow;</line>
<line>Or the Rose, the young, unmarried virgin?"</line>
<line>Thinking thus--at last the bird determined--</line>
<line>And he whisper'd to himself sedately,</line>
<line>"Gold--though long employ'd, is far, far better</line>
<line>Than the finest silver freshly melted,"</line>
<line>So he kiss'd--kiss'd Hyacinth, the widow.</line>
<line>Very wroth wax'd then young Rose, the virgin:</line>
<line>"Sarajevo! let a ban be on thee!</line>
<line>Cursed be thy strange and evil customs!</line>
<line>For thy youths they love the bygone widows,</line>
<line>And thy aged men the untried virgins."</line></stanza>

<title>CHRIST THINKS OF HIS MOTHER</title>

<line>Weepeth in bitter agony:</line>
<line>"Let herald hasten now to tell her</line>
<line>I am risen unto heaven."</line>

<line>"O thou of women all most blest,</line>
<line>Let not thy heart with fear be filled;</line>
<line>From the tomb thy Son is risen,</line>
<line>Risen to the Father's throne,</line>
<line>Saving men from Death's dominion."</line></stanza>
