In our analysis of gender in the Serbian women's songs, we determined that
our initial hypothesis was incorrect. We thought that women would be mentioned less
frequently than men, and that their description would be more negative.

This was not the case. Women are mentioned more frequently than men by far, with roughly
three times the number of "noun" elements (either common nouns, names, or pronouns) having
a female attribute than a male one. The number of adjectives used to describe these nouns
was similarly disproportionate, with the same roughly three-to-one ratio in favor of women.

The second surprise was how much more positive the female adjectives, on average, were
than the male ones. While both men and women do have more positive than negative adjectives,
women have more than three positive adjectives for every negative adjective, whereas men
come in at slightly less than a two-to-one ratio.
