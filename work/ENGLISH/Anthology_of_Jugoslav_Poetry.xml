        <title>FAREWELL[3]</title>

        <stanza>
            <l>Against white Buda's walls, a vine</l>
            <l>Doth its white branches fondly twine;</l>
            <l>O, no! it was no vine-tree there;</l>
            <l>It was a fond, a faithful pair,</l>
            <l>Bound each to each in earliest vow--</l>
            <l>And, O! they must be severed now!</l>
            <l>And these their farewell words:--"We part--</l>
            <l>Break from my bosom--break--my heart!</l>
            <l>Go to a garden--go, and see,</l>
            <l>Some rose-branch blushing on the tree;</l>
            <l>And from that branch of rose-flower tear,</l>
            <l>Then place it on thy bosom bare;</l>
            <l>And as its leaflets fade and pine,</l>
            <l>So fades my sinking heart in thine."</l>
            <l>And thus the other spoke: "My love!</l>
            <l>A few short paces backward move,</l>
            <l>And to the verdant forest go;</l>
            <l>There's a fresh water-fount below;</l>
            <l>And in the fount a marble stone,</l>
            <l>Which a gold cup reposes on;</l>
            <l>And in the cup a ball of snow--</l>
            <l>Love! take that ball of snow to rest</l>
            <l>Upon thine heart within thy breast.</l>
            <l>And as it melts unnoticed there,</l>
            <l>So melts my heart in thine, my dear!"</l>

        <title>DEER AND VILA</title>

        <stanza>
            <l>A young deer tracked his way through the green forest,</l>
            <l>One lonely day--another came in sadness;</l>
            <l>And the third dawn'd, and brought him sighs and sorrow:</l>
            <l>Then he address'd him to the forest Vila:</l>
            <l>"Young deer!" she said, "thou wild one of the forest,</l>
            <l>Now tell me what great sorrow has oppress'd thee?</l>
            <l>Why wanderest thou thus in the forest lonely:</l>
            <l>Lonely one day,--another day in sadness,--</l>
            <l>And the third day with sighs and anguish groaning?"</l>
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <l>And thus the young deer to the Vila answer'd:</l>
            <l>"O thou sweet sister! Vila of the forest!</l>
            <l>Me has indeed a heavy grief befallen;</l>
            <l>For I had once a fawn, mine own beloved,</l>
            <l>And one sad day she sought the running water:</l>
            <l>She enter'd it, but came not back to bless me:</l>
            <l>Then tell me, had she lost her way and wander'd?</l>
            <l>Was she pursued and captured by the huntsman?</l>
            <l>Or has she left me?--has she wholly left me?--</l>
            <l>Loving some other deer--and I forgotten.</l>
            <l>O! if she has but lost her way, and wanders,</l>
            <l>Teach her to find it--bring her back to love me.</l>
            <l>O! if she has been captured by the huntsman,</l>
            <l>Then may a fate as sad as mine await him.</l>
            <l>But if she has forsaken me--if, faithless,</l>
            <l>She loves another deer--and I forgotten--</l>
            <l>Then may the huntsman speedily o'er take her."</l>

        <title>VIRGIN AND WIDOW</title>

        <stanza>
            <l>Over Sarajevo flies a falcon,</l>
            <l>Looking round for cooling shade to cool him.</l>
            <l>Then he finds a pine on Sarajevo;</l>
            <l>Under it a well of sparkling water;</l>
            <l>By the water, Hyacinth, the widow,</l>
            <l>And the Rose, the young, unmarried virgin.</l>

            <l>Or the Rose, the young, unmarried virgin?"</l>
            <l>Thinking thus--at last the bird determined--</l>

            <l>"Gold--though long employ'd, is far, far better</l>
            <l>Than the finest silver freshly melted,"</l>
            <l>So he kiss'd--kiss'd Hyacinth, the widow.</l>
            <l>Very wroth wax'd then young Rose, the virgin:</l>
            <l>"Sarajevo! let a ban be on thee!</l>
            <l>Cursed be thy strange and evil customs!</l>
            <l>For thy youths they love the bygone widows,</l>

            <l>O'er her grave a chapel he erected,</l>

        <stanza>
            <l>Sleep will not take the place of Love,</l>
            <l>Nor keep the place from Sorrow.</l>
            <l>Oh, when the long nights slowly move</l>
            <l>To meet a lonely morrow,</l>
            <l>The burden of the broken days,</l>
            <l>The grief that on the bosom weighs,</l>
            <l>And all the heart oppresses,</l>
            <l>But lightly lies on restless eyes</l>
            <l>Love seals no more with kisses.</l>

            <l>Sweet sister of my loved, unloving one,</l>
            <l>Kiss thy wild brother, kiss him tenderly!</l>
            <l>Ask him what is it, witless, I have done</l>
            <l>That he should look so coldly upon me?</l>
            <l>Ah, well ... I know he recks not! Let it be.</l>
            <l>Yet say ... "There's many a woodland nodding yet</l>
            <l>For who needs wood when winter nights be cold."</l>
            <l>Say ... "Love to give finds ever love to get.</l>
            <l>There lack not goldsmiths where there lacks not gold.</l>
            <l>The wood will claim the woodman by-and-by;</l>
            <l>The gold (be sure!) the goldsmith cannot miss;</l>
            <l>Each maid to win finds lads to woo: and I...."</l>
            <l>Well, child, but only tell him, tell him this!</l>
            <l>Sweet sister, tell him this!</l>

            <l>I dreamed and lo! a great tree grew,</l>
            <l>Its branches from my own heart crept,</l>
            <l>O'erspreading earth north, south, east, west,</l>
            <l>And towering up through heaven's blue.</l>
            <l>What saith this vision Saint, to you?"</l>
            <l>Then Basil answered to the Virgin:</l>
            <l>"O sister dear, thy vision's clear:</l>
            <l>'A tree did spring from thy warm heart?'</l>
            <l>To bear the Christ shall be thy part.</l>
            <l>'Those spreading branches covering all?'</l>
            <l>Sinners He'll save from evil's thrall.</l>
            <l>'That height spire-piercing heaven's blue?'</l>
            <l>To God the Father Christ shall rise</l>
            <l>Passing from earth and fleshly view."</l>

            <l>Alas! my son, how fareth it with thee,</l>
            <l>In thy new dwelling, new and strange and dark?</l>
            <l>Strange thy dwelling without windows!</l>
            <l>At daybreak, Vinko, thy sad <noun gender="female">mother</noun>

            <l>Her earliest thought as but of thee,</l>
            <l>Her first thought, Vinko; Vinko her first call!</l>
            <l>Thorns are growing at the house-door,</l>
            <l>Cuckoos mourn around the house,</l>
            <l>Downcast thy brothers wait for thee,</l>
            <l>To talk with thee, to walk with thee--</l>
            <l>But now that ne'er can be.</l>
            <l>With head bent down and brow o'ercast,</l>
            <l>They make their way--for where art thou!</l>
            <l>In ashes our hearth fire is hidden,</l>
            <l>And when I saw the sun this morning,</l>
            <l>I thought: It is the moon,</l>
            <l>When thy sisters said to me:</l>
            <l>"Dim thine eyes, it is the sun!"</l>
            <l>"For me no sun," said I to them,</l>

            <l>Down in thy dwelling, oh my son,</l>
            <l>Say, is it cold, my Sun, my Sun;</l>
            <l>If it be cold as is my breast</l>
            <l>It is too cold, too cold to rest.[37]</l>

        <title><noun gender="female">girl</noun> IS ETERNAL POSSESSION[59]</title>

        <stanza>
            <l>In a garden works a <noun gender="female">maiden</noun>,</l>
            <l>Digging furrow, water decoy,</l>
            <l>To the garden 'luring water,</l>
            <l>To give drink to early flowers,</l>
            <l>Early flowers, whitest basil,</l>
            <l>Whitest basil, gold carnation;</l>
            <l>Where she's furrowing, there she's sleeping.</l>
            <l>Putting head in sweetest basil,</l>
            <l>Hands are lying in carnations,</l>
            <l>Feet are plac'd in shallow hollow,</l>
            <l>Covered with a fragile kerchief;</l>
            <l>Beat upon her dew-drops slender,</l>
            <l>Like a rain-soaked watermelon.</l>
            <l>Now there comes a callow youth,</l>
            <l>Callow <noun gender="male">youth</noun>and not yet married,</l>
            <l>Grasping two posts, leaps the railing,</l>
            <l>Springing lightly into garden,</l>
            <l>Then commences soliloquizing:</l>
            <l>"Should I pluck a bunch of flowers?</l>
            <l>Should I kiss a sleeping <noun gender="female">maiden</noun>?</l>
            <l>Bunch of flowers lasts till mid-day,</l>
            <l>But a <noun gender="female">maiden</noun> lasts forever."</l>

        <title>JOVO AND MARIA[60]</title>

        <stanza>
            <l>Breeze fans up o'er roses 'long the meadow,</l>
            <l>To the rich white tent of Jovo, youthful,</l>
            <l>Where there's Jovo with Maria sitting:</l>
            <l>Jovo writing and Maria sewing;</l>
            <l>Ink runs short for Jovo where he's writing,</l>
            <l>And Maria golden thread is losing,</l>
            <l>Then to Maria, Jovo thus is speaking:</l>
            <l>"Oh, my Maria, mine own cherish'd lov'd one!</l>
            <l>Is my soul to thee a dear possession?</l>
            <l>For a pillow is my right hand doughty?"</l>
            <l>Mara to him gently whispering slowly:</l>
            <l>"Believe me, Jovo, darling of my heart-throb,</l>
            <l>Dearer to me is thy soul much dearer,</l>
            <l>Than are altogether four of brothers;</l>
            <l>Softer to me thy own right hand doughty,</l>
            <l>Than four softest pillows of my choosing."</l>

        <title>WIFE DEARER THAN SISTER[67]</title>

        <stanza>
            <l>Lo! behold behind the forest</l>
            <l>Someone loudly screams--</l>
            <l>"'Tis a voice," says youthful hero,</l>
            <l>"<noun gender="female">girl</noun>ish-like it seems."</l>
            <l>When behold! he looked and spied her,</l>
            <l>Tiny <noun gender="female">girl</noun>, tree-bound they'd tied
                her,</l>
            <l>With fine silken seams.</l>
            <l>Hear! she prays of youthful hero, dazzled by his might:</l>
            <l>"Come to me, thou youthful hero, O most beauteous, wonderknight.</l>
            <l>Come to free me, youthful hero, and I'll be thy sister true."</l>
            <l>Thus she spake, but laughing he, "O, there's one at home like you."</l>
            <l>"Come to free me then, my brother; sister-in-law I'll be no other."</l>
            <l>('But at home she sits by <noun gender="female">mother</noun>.')</l>
            <l>"Then I'll be thy golden bride.</l>
            <l>Take me to thy meadows wide,</l>
            <l>Take me to thy castles white,</l>
            <l>Take me, take me from this plight."</l>
            <l>So she spake to gallant lover,</l>
            <l>Hovering near and just above her,</l>
            <l>Clasps her in his arms to love her--</l>
            <l>Such a gallant knight!</l>
