<t>  THE CURSE[1]</t>

<s>
I heard a sprightly swallow say
To a gray cuckoo t'other day,--
"Thou art a happy bird indeed;
Thou dost not in the chimney breed,
Thou dost not hear the eternal jarring,
Of sisters and step-sisters warring;
Their woes and grievances rehearsing,
Cursing themselves, and others cursing."
A young step-sister once I saw,
Foul language at the elder throw;
"Perdition's daughter! hence depart;
Thou hast no fruit beneath thy heart."
And thus the elder one replied:
"Curse thy perverseness and thy pride!
Mihailo is a son of thine;
Now thou shalt bring forth daughters nine,
And madness shall their portion be.
Thy son shall cross the parting sea;
He never shall return to thee,
But, bathed in blood and wounded, pine!"
And thus she cursed;--the curse was true;[2]
Her sister's nine fair daughters grew;
And madness seized them,--seized them all:
Mihailo,--far away, and wounded,
By solitude and woe surrounded,
I heard him on his mother call:
"O mother! mother! send me now
A bandage of that snowy linen
Which you so thoughtlessly were spinning,
When curses wander'd to and fro.
In your rage you wove it,--now remove it;
Tear it for bandages, as you tore
Love and affection all asunder.
Where it was bleach'd thy son lies under;
With it cover his hot wounds o'er.
Rend it, mother; and send it, mother!
May it thy suffering son restore!"</s>

<t>  FAREWELL[3]</t>

<s>
Against white Buda's walls, a vine
Doth its white branches fondly twine;
O, no! it was no vine-tree there;
It was a fond, a faithful pair,
Bound each to each in earliest vow--
And, O! they must be severed now!
And these their farewell words:--"We part--
Break from my bosom--break--my heart!
Go to a garden--go, and see,
Some rose-branch blushing on the tree;
And from that branch of rose-flower tear,
Then place it on thy bosom bare;
And as its leaflets fade and pine,
So fades my sinking heart in thine."
And thus the other spoke: "My love!
A few short paces backward move,
And to the verdant forest go;
There's a fresh water-fount below;
And in the fount a marble stone,
Which a gold cup reposes on;
And in the cup a ball of snow--
Love! take that ball of snow to rest
Upon thine heart within thy breast.
And as it melts unnoticed there,
So melts my heart in thine, my dear!"</s>

<t>  THE VIOLET[4]</t>

<s>
How captivating is to me,
Sweet flower! thine own young modesty!
Though did I pluck thee from thy stem,
There's none would wear thy purple gem.
I thought, perchance, that Ali Bey--
But he is proud and lofty--nay!
He would not prize thee--would not wear
A flower so feeble though so fair:
His turban for its decorations
Had full blown roses and carnations.</s>

<t>  SMILIA[5]</t>

<s>
Sweet Smilia-flowers did Smilia pull,
Her sleevelets and her bosom full;
By the cool stream she gather'd them,
And twined her many a diadem--
A diadem of flowery-wreaths;--
One round her brows its fragrance breathes;
One to her bosom-friend she throws;
The other where the streamlet flows
She flings, and says in gentlest tone--
"Swim on, thou odorous wreath! swim on,
Swim to my Juris' home, and there
O whisper in his mother's ear:
'Say, wilt thou not thy Juris wed?--
Then give him not a widow's bed;
But some sweet maiden, young and fair.'"</s>

Beauty's maiden thus invoked the Heavens:
"Send me down a whirlwind! let it scatter
Yonder stony tower--its halls lay open!
Let me look on Ger[vc]i['c] Manoilo.
If the otter on his knee is playing--
If the falcon sits upon his shoulder--
If the rose is blooming on his kalpak."[7]
What she pray'd for speedily was granted:
And a storm-wind came across the ocean;
And the stony tower fell down before it:
And she look'd on Ger[vc]i['c] Manoilo:
Saw the otter on his knees disporting:
Saw the falcon sitting on his shoulder:
Saw the rose upon his kalpak blooming.</s>

What's the time of night, my dear?
For my maiden said, "I'll come"--
Said "I'll come,"--but is not here:
And 'tis now the midnight's gloom.
Lone and silent home I turn'd;
But upon the bridge I met her--
Kiss'd her: How my hot lips burned!--
How forget it--how forget her!
In one kiss full ten I drew:
And upon my lips there grew,
From that hour, a honey-dew,
As if sugar were my meat,
And my drink metheglin sweet.</s>

The maiden cursed her raven eyes,
She cursed them for their treacheries.
"Be blinded now, to you if heaven
All that is visible has given!
If ye see all, ye traitors, say
Why saw ye not my love to-day:--
He pass'd my door,--but, truants, ye
Gave not the gentlest hint to me.
He had a nosegay in his hand,--
He wore a gold embroider'd band.[10]
'Twas made by other hands than mine!
Upon it wreathing branches twine:
May every branch embroidered there,
A miserable heart-wound bear;--
Upon each branch, may every leaf
Bring and betoken toil and grief."</s>

<t>  SALUTATION OF THE MORNING STAR</t>

<s>
Lo! the maiden greets the day-star! "Sister!
Sister star of morning! well I greet thee;
Thou dost watch the world from thine uprising
To thy sinking hour.  In Hercegovina,
Tell me didst thou see the princely Stephan?
Tell me, was his snowy palace open,
Were his steeds caparisoned, and ready;
And was he equipp'd his bride to visit?"</s>

<s>  Gently then the morning star responded:
"Lovely sister! beautiful young maiden,
True, I watch the world from my uprising
To my setting;--and in Hercegovina
Saw the palace of the princely Stephan;
And that snowy palace was wide open,
And his horse was saddled, and was ready,
And he was equipp'd his bride to visit:
But not thee--not thee--another maiden;
False tongues three have whisper'd evil of thee;
One has said--thine origin is lowly;
One, that thou art treacherous as a serpent;
And the third, that thou art dull and dreamy."</s>

<s>  Then the maiden pour'd her imprecations:
"He who said my origin was lowly,
Never let a child of love be born him;
He who called me treacherous as a serpent,
Round his heart, O! let a serpent wreathe it;
Through hot summers in his hair be tangled,
Through cold winters in his bosom nestle;
He who dar'd to call me dull and dreamy,
Nine long years may he be worn by sickness,
And no sleep renew his strength to bear it."</s>

Thy finest silk for dog-grass leave,
And all thy knots with nettles tie."</s>

"Rose of mine! O fall, not on the maiden,
I am in no tune of soul to love thee,
For a heavy grief o'erwhelms my spirit;
Youth would have me--but old age hath won me.
An old bridegroom is a worthless maple;
When the wind is up it faints and trembles;
When the rain descends, decay decays it:
But a young bride, is a roselet budding;
When the wind is up, its fair leaves open,
When the rain descends, it shines in beauty,--
When the sun comes forth, it smiles and glories."</s>

The sun complain'd to God of such an insult:
"What shall be done with this presumptuous maiden?"
And to the sun God gave a speedy answer:
"Thou glorious Sun! thou my beloved daughter![13]
Be joyous yet! say, why art thou dejected?
Wilt thou reward the maiden for her folly--
Shine on, and burn the maiden's snowy forehead.
But I a gloomier dowry yet will give her;
Evil to her shall be her husband's brother;
Evil to her shall be her husband's father.
Then shall she think upon the affront she gave thee."</s>

Then from his cloudy heights he lowers,
And seats him on the city's towers:
He sees a laughing girl of grace,
In crystal water bathe her face;
And looks with open, eager eye
Upon her neck of ivory:
White as the snow upon the mountain;
And there he hears a youth recounting
His tale of love.--"Now bend thy head
Upon thy snowy neck," he said;
"Its whiteness is too bright for me:
And 'neath it sorrowing heart may be."</s>

<t>  DEER AND VILA</t>

<s>
A young deer tracked his way through the green forest,
One lonely day--another came in sadness;
And the third dawn'd, and brought him sighs and sorrow:
Then he address'd him to the forest Vila:
"Young deer!" she said, "thou wild one of the forest,
Now tell me what great sorrow has oppress'd thee?
Why wanderest thou thus in the forest lonely:
Lonely one day,--another day in sadness,--
And the third day with sighs and anguish groaning?"</s>

<s>  And thus the young deer to the Vila answer'd:
"O thou sweet sister! Vila of the forest!
Me has indeed a heavy grief befallen;
For I had once a fawn, mine own beloved,
And one sad day she sought the running water:
She enter'd it, but came not back to bless me:
Then tell me, had she lost her way and wander'd?
Was she pursued and captured by the huntsman?
Or has she left me?--has she wholly left me?--
Loving some other deer--and I forgotten.
O! if she has but lost her way, and wanders,
Teach her to find it--bring her back to love me.
O! if she has been captured by the huntsman,
Then may a fate as sad as mine await him.
But if she has forsaken me--if, faithless,
She loves another deer--and I forgotten--
Then may the huntsman speedily o'er take her."</s>

Over Sarajevo flies a falcon,
Looking round for cooling shade to cool him.
Then he finds a pine on Sarajevo;
Under it a well of sparkling water;
By the water, Hyacinth, the widow,
And the Rose, the young, unmarried virgin.
He look'd down--the falcon--and bethought him:
"Shall I kiss grave Hyacinth, the widow;
Or the Rose, the young, unmarried virgin?"
Thinking thus--at last the bird determined--
And he whisper'd to himself sedately,
"Gold--though long employ'd, is far, far better
Than the finest silver freshly melted,"
So he kiss'd--kiss'd Hyacinth, the widow.
Very wroth wax'd then young Rose, the virgin:
"Sarajevo! let a ban be on thee!
Cursed be thy strange and evil customs!
For thy youths they love the bygone widows,
And thy aged men the untried virgins."</s>

O that I were a little stream,
That I might flow to him--to him!
How should I dance with joy, when knowing
To whom my sparkling wave was flowing!
Beneath his window would I glide,
And linger there till morning-tide;
When first he rouses him to dress
In comely garb his manliness,--
Then should he weak, or thirsty be,
O he might stoop to drink of me!
Or baring there his bosom, lave
That bosom in my rippling wave
O what a bliss, if I could bear
The cooling power of quiet there!</s>

A triple woe to me.
The first, first woe my spirit knew,
My first, first woe was this,
My mother never train'd me to
A lover's early bliss
My second woe, my second woe,
Was that my trusty steed,
Whene'er I mounted, seem'd to show
Nor eagerness nor speed.
My third, third woe--of all the worst,
Is that the maid I woo,
The maid I lov'd the best--the first,
Is angry with me, too.
Then dig an early grave for me,
Yon whiten'd fields among;
In breadth two lances let it be,
And just four lances long.
And o'er my head let roses grow,
There plant the red-rose tree;
And at my feet a fount shall flow,
O scoop that fount for me!
So when a youthful swain appears,
The roses he shall wreathe;
And when an old man bent with years,
He'll drink the stream beneath.</s>

So to give me cheeks of rose and lily;

Or heavy is thy nuptial vow?"--
And thus the maid the youth address'd:

Far dearer, Ranko! than the whole
Of brothers--many though they be:
And that the vows we pledged together

Fix'd pearls above, and pearls beneath;

Vows: "O come to me:

Come--but slightly.
Come at eve--lest harm betide thee.
If any home thou seek,
In our quiet dwelling hide thee;
Not a whisper speak."

Lo! a twig he tore:
When the house-door ope he flung,
Noisy was the door.
When he enter'd in, there fell
Shelves upon the floor,

Trips and cuts her knee;

In perplexity.

When little birds sing,
And flowers do talk
From stalk to stalk;
Whispering to a silver shower,
A violet did boast to be
Of every flower the fairest flower
That blows by lawn or lea.
But a rose that blew thereby
Answer'd her reproachfully,
(All in the spring,
When little birds sing,
And flowers do talk
From stalk to stalk):
"Violet, I marvel me
Of fairest flowers by lawn or lea
The fairest thou should'st boast to be;
For one small defect I spy,
Should make thee speak more modestly:
Thy face is fashion'd tenderly,
But then it hangs awry."</s>

Come lightly, come softly, at set of the sun!
Come, and caress me!

Fold me, and hold me!
Kiss me with kisses that leave not a trace,
But set not the print of thy teeth on my face,

When the dew of the dawn trembles from it,
And as dawn-stars her blue eyes to me:
Her eyebrows so dark are the slender sea-leeches;
Her rich-bloomed cheeks are the ripe river peaches,
Her teeth are white pearls from the sea;
Her lips are two half-open'd roses;
And her breath the south wind, which discloses
The sweetness that soothes the wild bee.
She is tall as the larch, she is slender
As any green bough the birds move;
See her dance--'tis the peacock's full splendour!
Hear her talk--'tis the coo of the dove!
And, only but let her look tender--
'Tis all heaven melting down from above!</s>

<t>  CHRIST THINKS OF HIS MOTHER</t>

On angel wing in upward flight
Rise soul and body of our Lord,
When piercing heaven with high gaze,
He calleth for one down to go,
Down to darksome Golgotha,
Where Mary bending near the Cross,
Weepeth in bitter agony:
"Let herald hasten now to tell her
I am risen unto heaven."
Great Michael heard, two angels sent,
Swift to convey the tidings glad:
"O thou of women all most blest,
Let not thy heart with fear be filled;
From the tomb thy Son is risen,
Risen to the Father's throne,
Saving men from Death's dominion."</s>

The Blessed Mary sent an angel
Unto John the Camel-girdled--
"God's wish it is, and my wish too,
That thou shouldst now my Son baptize."
John went responsive to the river,
Down into Jordan with the Christ,
And there upon him with his Lord,
Open wide the gate of heaven,
The roseate sun did light the east,
Sign of that Spirit-first of which spake John,
Whose purging heat doth purify from sin,
And in Jordan's flowing river
Man's sin was taken all away!
Our salvation is in heaven!
Save, O God, all trusting souls,
Save them from the devil's toils.</s>

<t>  THE HOLY MOTHER</t>

<s>
Sadly walked the Holy Mother
On the Holy Mountain.
Suddenly espied she something
Brightly shining in the dust:
The Cross, it was, of her own Son.
With gentlest hands she caressed it,
She did wash it with her tears,
And after dried it with her hair.
Kneeling then she uttered prayer.
Speaking to the Holy Cross:
"O sweet Cross, thou Cross of honour,
Upon thee my Son has died,
Hellish pains on thee He suffered,
Hellish pains from those hot nails,
To redeem our sinful souls.
When He did upon thee bleed,
His blood it fell in priceless seed,
Whence there sprang all lovely flowers,
And angels, coming down to gather,
Made them into wreathes and garlands
That they might adorn all heaven."</s>

The Holy Virgin dreaming slept,
And in her dream a great tree grew,
Its branches from her own heart crept,
O'er spreading earth, north, south, east, west,
And piercing, spire-like, heaven's blue.
Sore troubled by her dream she rose
And sought straightway a saintly brother;
"Hear Saint Basil, my brother hear!
Let me tell my vision wondrous
I dreamed and lo! a great tree grew,
Its branches from my own heart crept,
O'erspreading earth north, south, east, west,
And towering up through heaven's blue.
What saith this vision Saint, to you?"
Then Basil answered to the Virgin:
"O sister dear, thy vision's clear:
'A tree did spring from thy warm heart?'
To bear the Christ shall be thy part.
'Those spreading branches covering all?'
Sinners He'll save from evil's thrall.
'That height spire-piercing heaven's blue?'
To God the Father Christ shall rise
Passing from earth and fleshly view."</s>

Alas! my son, how fareth it with thee,
In thy new dwelling, new and strange and dark?
Strange thy dwelling without windows!
At daybreak, Vinko, thy sad mother rose,
Her earliest thought as but of thee,
Her first thought, Vinko; Vinko her first call!
Thorns are growing at the house-door,
Cuckoos mourn around the house,
Downcast thy brothers wait for thee,
To talk with thee, to walk with thee--
But now that ne'er can be.
With head bent down and brow o'ercast,
They make their way--for where art thou!
In ashes our hearth fire is hidden,
And when I saw the sun this morning,
I thought: It is the moon,
When thy sisters said to me:
"Dim thine eyes, it is the sun!"
"For me no sun," said I to them,
"Pale in the dust now is my sun,
No light have I above the earth."
Down in thy dwelling, oh my son,
Say, is it cold, my Sun, my Sun;
If it be cold as is my breast
It is too cold, too cold to rest.[37]</s>

O'er Neven woods the sun went down,
The sun went down behind the forest,
As came the heroes off the sea.
The young wife counted anxiously,
The wife of George the Hospodar,
Counted the warriors, found them all,
Save her three treasures who were missing.
She could not find her Hospodar
Nor the best man at their wedding,
And the third treasure was not there;
This treasure was her dearest brother.
For her brave lord she cuts her tresses,
For her best man she wounds her cheeks,
And for her brother puts out both her eyes.
She cuts her hair, it grows again;
She wounds her cheeks, the wounds do heal;
But none can heal those hurt blind eyes,
Nor yet her heart for her lost brother.</s>

Covered with a fragile kerchief;
Beat upon her dew-drops slender,
Like a rain-soaked watermelon.
Now there comes a callow youth,
Callow youth and not yet married,
Grasping two posts, leaps the railing,
Springing lightly into garden,
Then commences soliloquizing:
"Should I pluck a bunch of flowers?
Should I kiss a sleeping maiden?
Bunch of flowers lasts till mid-day,
But a maiden lasts forever."</s>

<t>  JOVO AND MARIA[60]</t>

<s>
Breeze fans up o'er roses 'long the meadow,
To the rich white tent of Jovo, youthful,
Where there's Jovo with Maria sitting:
Jovo writing and Maria sewing;
Ink runs short for Jovo where he's writing,
And Maria golden thread is losing,
Then to Maria, Jovo thus is speaking:
"Oh, my Maria, mine own cherish'd lov'd one!
Is my soul to thee a dear possession?
For a pillow is my right hand doughty?"
Mara to him gently whispering slowly:
"Believe me, Jovo, darling of my heart-throb,
Dearer to me is thy soul much dearer,
Than are altogether four of brothers;
Softer to me thy own right hand doughty,
Than four softest pillows of my choosing."</s>

<t>  ROSE TREE[61]</t>

<s>
Planted rose-tree midst of Novi-Sad town,
O my rose-bud, O my sorrow rose tree,
Cannot pick you, neither give you sweetheart:
For my sweetie vents her anger on me,
Gliding past my courtyard stealthy,
Like the slave who passes Turkish graveyard.</s>

O my darling, be not wrathful;
Should I, myself, show my hot displeasure,
All of Bosnia never could appease us,
Not all Bosnia nor the Hercegovina.</s>

<t>  LAD PIERCED WITH ARROW[63]</t>

<s>
Alas hero I'm with arrow pierced,
O my Yetsa, thy white face is guilty,
Thy black eye-balls are the piercing arrows,
Thy white arms are now a very torment.
Come, my love bird, to my white court homing,
Come to heal my heart's own sore displeasure,
To bind up my wounds with thy throat's whiteness,
To salve suffering with thy honey kisses.</s>

<t>  NOUGHT BUT KISSES[64]</t>

<s>
Up and down went youth in mountain,
In a garden, girl round fountain;
On her threw he hawthorn red,--
Lightly answering, blackthorn sped,--
Think you they intend to kill?
Nought but kisses that they will.</s>

To lead us near together!
I my life long would not quit her,
None could make our friendship wither.'</s>

Oh, my jeweller, for your trade's sake, listen!
Make me hero, all of gold my hero,
I will spoil him, as his mother dares not,
I will kiss him until dawns the twilight,
Till day breaks ever will caress him.</s>

<t>  WIFE DEARER THAN SISTER[67]</t>

<s>
Lo! behold behind the forest
Someone loudly screams--
"'Tis a voice," says youthful hero,
"Girlish-like it seems."
When behold! he looked and spied her,
Tiny girl, tree-bound they'd tied her,
With fine silken seams.
Hear! she prays of youthful hero, dazzled by his might:
"Come to me, thou youthful hero, O most beauteous, wonderknight.
Come to free me, youthful hero, and I'll be thy sister true."
Thus she spake, but laughing he, "O, there's one at home like you."
"Come to free me then, my brother; sister-in-law I'll be no other."
('But at home she sits by mother.')
"Then I'll be thy golden bride.
Take me to thy meadows wide,
Take me to thy castles white,
Take me, take me from this plight."
So she spake to gallant lover,
Hovering near and just above her,
Clasps her in his arms to love her--
Such a gallant knight!</s>

<t>  GREATEST SORROW[68]</t>

<s>All young heroes here save mine,
All young gallant heroes brave.
O! that I were sure he'd tarry,
Lingering in some sickness grave,
Rather than the wish to marry
Sends him courting another maid.
O! may he be too ill to travel,
May him dread illness cause to pine,
Rather than to court another,
Never, never to be mine.</s>

<t>  YOUTH AND GIRL[69]</t>

O maiden, thou gentlest rose
When thou wert growing what didst thou behold?
Hast thou observed a pine-tree growing
Or the slender, proud fir-tree blowing,
Or did'st gaze at my youngest brother?--</s>

<s>  O glad, young hero, brilliant Sun!
Never at the pine-tree blowing
Have I look'd in wonder gazing
Neither at the slender fir-tree,
Nor thy youngest brother, free,
Rather have I grown to suit thee,
Tender knight, to suit but thee.</s>
